# Blackjack Gameplay - Capstone Project

### Game rules: The goal is to to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21.
1. The deck is unlimited in size and you can play a new game as many times as you want. 
2. All the cards from 2 to 10 are counted as their face value. There are no jokers. The Jack, Queen and King each count as 10. and the other special card is the Ace, which can either count as a 1 or a 11 towards your total depending on whether you've gone over 21 or if you're under 21.
3. You get 2 cards in the beginning, and can view one of the cards of the dealer.
4. Blackjack is the case when we have a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10. If the dealer or the user has a blackjack, then the game ends. Whoever gets a blackjack wins.
5. If your totals are the same, its a draw, even in the case of Blackjack.
6. If the cards in your hand add up two more than 21 (a bust), you lose immediately.
7. The dealer has to keep drawing cards as long as his total is less than 17.
8. If in the end, your card total is less than the dealer's total (provided the dealer's total is below 21), you lose. Otherwise, you win.
